 * Objective:
 * Create a method that will take in an ArrayList of Integers called nums,
 * an int called "from", an int called "to" as parameters.
 *
 * In the method, remove the range of integers that start at "from" and end at "to" inclusive.
 * The range is not based on index it is based on the value of "from" & "to"
